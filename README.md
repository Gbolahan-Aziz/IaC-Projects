# IaC-Projects
Infrastructure as Code is the practice in software development and engineering that involves managing and provisioning computing infrastructure through machine-readable script files.
Infrastructure as Code is the industry standard methodology of provisioning infrastructure. This is so for a number of reason such as:
- Version Control and History: IaC allows you to version control your infrastructure configurations. This means you can track changes over time, roll back to previous versions, and collaborate with others more effectively. This is similar to the benefits gained from version controlling software code.

- Reproducibility: With IaC, you can recreate entire environments in a consistent and reliable manner. This is crucial for development, testing, and production environments to ensure that what works in one environment will work identically in another.

- Automation: IaC enables automation of infrastructure provisioning and configuration, reducing the manual effort required for repetitive tasks. This leads to faster and more reliable deployments.

- Consistency: IaC ensures that infrastructure is provisioned consistently every time it is deployed. This consistency helps avoid configuration drift, where changes to the infrastructure occur over time, leading to discrepancies between environments.

- Scalability: IaC facilitates the scaling of infrastructure horizontally or vertically by adjusting configuration files. This makes it easier to handle increased workloads or resource requirements.

- Collaboration: Since IaC files are often stored in version control systems, multiple team members can collaborate on infrastructure changes. This promotes better communication, knowledge sharing, and a more transparent development process.

- Documentation: IaC serves as documentation for your infrastructure. The configuration files describe how the infrastructure is set up and configured, making it easier for team members to understand and manage the infrastructure.

- Auditability and Compliance: IaC enables better tracking and auditing of changes to the infrastructure. This is important for compliance requirements and security best practices, as it allows organizations to demonstrate who made what changes and when.

- Adaptability and Portability: IaC makes it easier to adapt infrastructure to changing requirements. It also provides a level of portability, allowing you to deploy infrastructure across different cloud providers or on-premises environments using the same set of scripts.

- Cost Management: IaC can help optimize resource usage and costs by defining and controlling the exact specifications of infrastructure components. This can prevent over-provisioning and ensure efficient resource utilization.

This repository is dedicated to developing projects that leverage the use of IaC to provision infrastructure on different cloud providers.
