Terraform is an infrastructure as code tool that enables you to safely and predictably provision and manage infrastructure in any cloud. It is the most commonly used IaC tool because it is cloud agnostic, meaning it could be used across a lot of, if not all cloud providers. Terraform was developed by Hashicorp, it is a declarative IaC tool and makes use of the HCL (Hashicorp Configuration Language).

Projects in these folder will demonstrate how to use Terraform across several cloud providers such as:
- Azure
- AWS
